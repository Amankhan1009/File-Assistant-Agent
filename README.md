# File Assistant Using LangGraph

A secure, persistent, tool-calling AI file assistant built with LangGraph, LangChain, Groq, and SQLite.

The File Assistant accepts natural-language requests through a command-line interface, reasons about filesystem operations, selects and executes registered tools, observes tool results, and continues the LangGraph agent loop until it can produce a final response.

All filesystem operations are restricted to a configured workspace directory.

## Features

- Natural-language file and directory management
- LangGraph-based agent and tool execution loop
- 13 registered filesystem tools
- Persistent conversation threads using SQLite checkpoints
- Multiple isolated conversation sessions using thread IDs
- Bounded model context while retaining complete persisted history
- Restricted workspace path resolution
- Path traversal and absolute path protection
- Safe file creation without overwriting existing paths
- UTF-8 file reading and writing
- File and directory search
- File metadata inspection
- File and directory move and rename operations
- ZIP archive creation and secure extraction
- Explicit safeguards for destructive filesystem operations
- Structured tool error responses
- Tool execution observability without logging file contents
- Application logging to console and file
- Safe CLI error boundaries
- Graph recursion-limit handling
- Persistent storage initialization and cleanup handling
- Automated pytest test suite

## Architecture

The application uses a LangGraph tool-calling agent loop:

```text
START
  |
  v
agent
  |
  v
route_after_agent
  |
  +----------------------+
  |                      |
  | tool calls           | no tool calls
  v                      v
tools                   END
  |
  v
agent
```

The `agent` node invokes the tool-bound language model.

If the model returns tool calls, LangGraph routes execution to the `tools` node. After tool execution, the resulting `ToolMessage` objects are added to graph state and execution returns to the agent.

The loop continues until the model produces a response without additional tool calls.

## Registered Tools

The File Assistant exposes 13 filesystem tools to the agent.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `list_directory` | List direct contents of a directory |
| `create_directory` | Create a new directory without overwriting existing paths |
| `delete_directory` | Delete an existing empty directory |
| `read_file` | Read a UTF-8 text file |
| `create_file` | Create a new UTF-8 text file without overwriting |
| `append_file` | Append UTF-8 text to an existing file |
| `search_files` | Recursively search for files by name |
| `search_text` | Recursively search inside UTF-8 text files |
| `get_file_metadata` | Retrieve safe file or directory metadata |
| `delete_file` | Delete an existing regular file |
| `move_path` | Move or rename a file or directory |
| `compress_paths` | Create ZIP archives from workspace paths |
| `extract_archive` | Securely extract ZIP archives |

## Security Model

Filesystem access is restricted to the configured workspace.

The path-resolution layer:

- Rejects absolute paths
- Canonically resolves requested paths
- Rejects paths that escape the workspace
- Prevents parent-directory traversal outside the workspace
- Prevents filesystem tools from accessing paths outside the configured boundary

Destructive operations follow additional restrictions.

The assistant:

- Deletes only explicitly authorized paths
- Does not recursively empty non-empty directories automatically
- Does not delete additional paths merely to make another operation succeed
- Protects the workspace root from deletion and movement
- Does not overwrite existing destination paths during creation, movement, compression, or extraction

ZIP extraction includes validation against:

- Path traversal entries
- Symbolic links
- Excessive archive entry counts
- Excessive extracted data size
- Existing destination contents

## Persistent Conversation Threads

LangGraph state is persisted using `SqliteSaver`.

The SQLite checkpoint database allows conversations to continue across separate CLI executions.

Start the default session:

```bash
python app.py
```

Start or resume a named session:

```bash
python app.py --thread project-alpha
```

Different thread IDs maintain isolated conversation histories.

For example:

```bash
python app.py --thread project-alpha
python app.py --thread project-beta
```

Each thread is stored independently in the SQLite checkpoint database.

## Context Management

Complete graph history is persisted in SQLite, while only a bounded number of recent conversation turns are sent to the language model.

This design:

- Preserves durable conversation state
- Prevents model context from growing indefinitely
- Keeps complete tool-call sequences inside retained turns
- Avoids modifying persisted message history during context selection

The current model context limit is 10 recent conversation turns.

## Observability and Logging

The application uses structured logging for important runtime events.

Logged events include:

- Application startup and shutdown
- Agent invocation start and completion
- Agent routing decisions
- Tool execution start and completion
- Tool name
- Tool success status
- Tool error type
- Tool execution duration
- Graph recursion-limit failures
- Unexpected graph execution failures
- Persistent storage initialization and cleanup failures

Tool arguments, file contents, and sensitive tool results are not written to application logs.

Runtime logs are written to:

```text
logs/file_assistant.log
```

The log file is ignored by Git.

## Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Configure the environment variables:

```text
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
GROQ_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b

## Usage

Start the assistant:

```bash
python app.py
```

Use a named persistent conversation:

```bash
python app.py --thread project-alpha
```

Restart the same thread later to continue its persisted conversation history:

```bash
python app.py --thread project-alpha
```

Different thread IDs maintain isolated persistent conversation histories.

Example interaction:

```text
File Assistant started.
Session: file-assistant-cli
Type 'exit' or 'quit' to stop.

You: Create a file called notes.txt containing my project notes.

Assistant: The file notes.txt was created successfully.

You: Read notes.txt.

Assistant: The file contains: my project notes.

You: exit

File Assistant stopped.
```

## HTTP API

The File Assistant can also run as a FastAPI application.

The API reuses the same LangGraph agent, filesystem tools, SQLite checkpoint persistence, recursion protection, and logging infrastructure as the CLI application.

### Start the API Server

Run `uvicorn api.main:app --reload` from the project root.

The API is available locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

Interactive documentation:

- Swagger UI: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | Returns the API health status |
| POST | `/chat` | Executes one File Assistant interaction |

### Persistent Conversation Threads

The `thread_id` identifies a persistent LangGraph conversation. Requests using the same thread ID can access previous conversational context stored by the SQLite checkpointer, while different thread IDs remain isolated.
